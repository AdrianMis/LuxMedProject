## H2
The application is pre-configured to use an **H2 in-memory database** for local development. This makes it easier to get started without setting up a PostgreSQL instance.


# Task/test content
Write a microservice application, that implements a ‘CRUD’
with REST endpoints for JSON entity (not for all entities, only for root entity)
with the structure :
The root object is the company.
Each company has name and departments.
Each department has name and contains teams.
Each team has name and project.
Each project has a manager with contact information.
Using:
Java 21, Spring, Postgres, Maven, GIT (local repository), Docker (just to start app)
and any other technologies (for some converting for example)
Note: keep it simple and clear, fulfilling the minimum requirements
Push the project to the GitHub repository and share the link with us
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bonus rear (not required) : write tests for the service using any technologies and approaches that you
consider relevant for checking basic functionality
